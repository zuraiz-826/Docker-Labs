Lab 3: Working with Containers
Lab Objectives
By the end of this lab, students will be able to:

Create and run Docker containers from images
Access running containers using interactive commands
Inspect container details and configurations
Manage container lifecycle (start, stop, remove)
Understand container states and their implications
Apply fundamental container management skills for Docker Certified Associate (DCA) certification
Prerequisites
Before starting this lab, students should have:

Basic understanding of Docker concepts (images, containers, Docker daemon)
Familiarity with Linux command-line interface
Completion of previous Docker labs or equivalent knowledge
Understanding of basic system administration concepts
Note: Al Nafi provides pre-configured Linux-based cloud machines with Docker already installed. Simply click Start Lab to access your environment - no need to build your own VM or install Docker manually.

Lab Environment Setup
Your Al Nafi cloud machine comes with:

Ubuntu Linux operating system
Docker Engine pre-installed and configured
All necessary permissions configured for the lab user
Internet connectivity for downloading Docker images
To verify your environment is ready, run:

docker --version
docker info
Task 1: Create a New Container from an Image
Subtask 1.1: Understanding the Docker Run Command
The docker run command creates and starts a new container from a specified image. The -d flag runs the container in detached mode (in the background).

Subtask 1.2: Create an Ubuntu Container
Execute the following command to create a new Ubuntu container:

docker run -d --name my-ubuntu-container ubuntu sleep 3600
Command Breakdown:

docker run: Creates and starts a new container
-d: Runs container in detached mode (background)
--name my-ubuntu-container: Assigns a custom name to the container
ubuntu: Specifies the Ubuntu image to use
sleep 3600: Keeps the container running for 1 hour (3600 seconds)
Subtask 1.3: Verify Container Creation
Check that your container is running:

docker ps
You should see output similar to:

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND        CREATED         STATUS         PORTS     NAMES
abc123def456   ubuntu    "sleep 3600"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes             my-ubuntu-container
Subtask 1.4: Alternative Container Creation
Create another container without the sleep command to see different behavior:

docker run -d --name short-lived-ubuntu ubuntu
Check the status:

docker ps -a
Note: This container will exit immediately because Ubuntu containers need a running process to stay active.

Task 2: Access the Container Using Docker Exec
Subtask 2.1: Understanding Docker Exec
The docker exec command allows you to run commands inside a running container. This is essential for debugging, maintenance, and interactive work.

Subtask 2.2: Access the Running Container
Connect to your running Ubuntu container:

docker exec -it my-ubuntu-container /bin/bash
Command Breakdown:

docker exec: Executes a command in a running container
-it: Combines -i (interactive) and -t (pseudo-TTY) for terminal access
my-ubuntu-container: The name of your target container
/bin/bash: The command to execute (Bash shell)
Subtask 2.3: Explore Inside the Container
Once inside the container, try these commands:

# Check the operating system
cat /etc/os-release

# List current directory contents
ls -la

# Check running processes
ps aux

# Create a test file
echo "Hello from inside the container" > /tmp/test.txt

# Verify the file was created
cat /tmp/test.txt

# Exit the container
exit
Subtask 2.4: Execute Single Commands
You can also execute single commands without entering interactive mode:

# Check container's hostname
docker exec my-ubuntu-container hostname

# List files in /tmp directory
docker exec my-ubuntu-container ls -la /tmp

# Display the test file we created earlier
docker exec my-ubuntu-container cat /tmp/test.txt
Task 3: Inspect Container Details
Subtask 3.1: Understanding Docker Inspect
The docker inspect command provides detailed information about containers, including configuration, network settings, and runtime details.

Subtask 3.2: Inspect Your Container
Get detailed information about your container:

docker inspect my-ubuntu-container
This command returns a JSON object with comprehensive container details.

Subtask 3.3: Extract Specific Information
Use formatting options to extract specific details:

# Get container's IP address
docker inspect --format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' my-ubuntu-container

# Get container's state
docker inspect --format='{{.State.Status}}' my-ubuntu-container

# Get container's image
docker inspect --format='{{.Config.Image}}' my-ubuntu-container

# Get container's creation time
docker inspect --format='{{.Created}}' my-ubuntu-container
Subtask 3.4: Inspect Multiple Containers
You can inspect multiple containers simultaneously:

docker inspect my-ubuntu-container short-lived-ubuntu
Task 4: Stop and Remove Containers
Subtask 4.1: Understanding Container Lifecycle
Containers have several states:

Running: Container is actively executing
Stopped: Container has been stopped but still exists
Removed: Container has been deleted from the system
Subtask 4.2: Stop a Running Container
Stop your running container:

docker stop my-ubuntu-container
Verify the container is stopped:

docker ps -a
The STATUS column should show "Exited" for your container.

Subtask 4.3: Remove a Stopped Container
Remove the stopped container:

docker rm my-ubuntu-container
Verify the container is removed:

docker ps -a
The container should no longer appear in the list.

Subtask 4.4: Force Remove a Running Container
Create a new container and remove it while running:

# Create a new container
docker run -d --name test-container ubuntu sleep 1800

# Force remove the running container
docker rm -f test-container

# Verify removal
docker ps -a
Note: The -f flag forces removal of running containers by stopping them first.

Subtask 4.5: Clean Up Multiple Containers
Remove multiple containers at once:

# Create several test containers
docker run -d --name container1 ubuntu sleep 300
docker run -d --name container2 ubuntu sleep 300
docker run -d --name container3 ubuntu sleep 300

# Remove all three containers
docker rm -f container1 container2 container3
Task 5: Restart a Container and Explore Its State
Subtask 5.1: Create a Persistent Container
Create a new container that we'll use to demonstrate restart functionality:

docker run -d --name persistent-container ubuntu sleep 7200
Subtask 5.2: Create Data Inside the Container
Add some data to the container:

# Access the container
docker exec -it persistent-container /bin/bash

# Inside the container, create some files
echo "This is persistent data" > /home/data.txt
echo "Container restart test" > /home/restart-test.txt
mkdir /home/test-directory
echo "Directory content" > /home/test-directory/file.txt

# Exit the container
exit
Subtask 5.3: Stop the Container
Stop the container:

docker stop persistent-container
Verify it's stopped:

docker ps -a
Subtask 5.4: Restart the Container
Restart the stopped container:

docker start persistent-container
Verify it's running:

docker ps
Subtask 5.5: Verify Data Persistence
Check if the data we created earlier still exists:

# Check if files still exist
docker exec persistent-container ls -la /home/

# Display file contents
docker exec persistent-container cat /home/data.txt
docker exec persistent-container cat /home/restart-test.txt
docker exec persistent-container ls -la /home/test-directory/
Key Observation: Data created in the container's filesystem persists across container stops and starts, but will be lost if the container is removed.

Subtask 5.6: Explore Container State Changes
Monitor how container states change:

# Check current state
docker inspect --format='{{.State.Status}}' persistent-container

# Stop the container
docker stop persistent-container

# Check state after stopping
docker inspect --format='{{.State.Status}}' persistent-container

# Start the container again
docker start persistent-container

# Check state after starting
docker inspect --format='{{.State.Status}}' persistent-container
Subtask 5.7: Understanding Container Restart Policies
Create containers with different restart policies:

# Container that restarts automatically
docker run -d --name auto-restart --restart=always ubuntu sleep 60

# Container that restarts on failure
docker run -d --name restart-on-failure --restart=on-failure ubuntu sleep 60

# Check restart policies
docker inspect --format='{{.HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name}}' auto-restart
docker inspect --format='{{.HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name}}' restart-on-failure
Troubleshooting Common Issues
Issue 1: Container Exits Immediately
Problem: Container stops right after creation Solution: Ensure the container has a long-running process

# Instead of this (exits immediately)
docker run -d ubuntu

# Use this (stays running)
docker run -d ubuntu sleep 3600
Issue 2: Cannot Access Container with Exec
Problem: "docker exec" fails with "container not running" Solution: Verify container is running first

# Check container status
docker ps -a

# If stopped, start it first
docker start container-name

# Then use exec
docker exec -it container-name /bin/bash
Issue 3: Permission Denied Errors
Problem: Cannot perform certain operations inside container Solution: Some operations require root privileges

# Run exec as root user
docker exec -it --user root container-name /bin/bash
Issue 4: Container Name Already Exists
Problem: Error when creating container with existing name Solution: Remove the existing container or use a different name

# Remove existing container
docker rm container-name

# Or use a different name
docker run -d --name new-container-name ubuntu sleep 3600
Lab Cleanup
Before finishing the lab, clean up all created containers:

# Stop all running containers
docker stop $(docker ps -q)

# Remove all containers
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

# Verify cleanup
docker ps -a
